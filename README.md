# Jonathan Reyes Pérez

Hi, I’m Jonathan Reyes Pérez, a PhD student of physics at the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (FCFM-BUAP). I’m interested in the trends of Quantum Field Theory.  I’m currently learning Scattering Amplitudes, Helicity spinor formalism, BCFW recursion relations, Spin-Spinor formalism, supergravity. I’m looking to collaborate on whom are interested in those topics.
